# Capability Curve

## Author
Prof. Mauricio Soria Colina, Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional

## Summary
The modeling of the capability curve of an electric generation unit is developed. The safe operating regions of the synchronous generator and the limits that depend on its operation are determined.
It is a very useful development for the subjects of **Electrical Machines**, **Electrical Power Systems** and **Stability of Power Systems**. It is ready to be used in online learning and only the essential knowledge of electrical machines is required.
Programming in **MATLAB** is used through **Live Script** and explanatory graphs of the regions that are generated are developed.
Finally, this application can be used in the labor field of operators of electric generation plants to carry out a safe operation of synchronous generators of hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants.
Keywords: **Capability curve**, **synchronous generator**, **operating limits of generation plants**, **electric machines**, **MATLAB Live Script**, **courseware**

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand the safe operating limits of synchronous generators.
2. Develop a program that allows graphing the safe operating limits.
3. Analyze the safe operating points and regions of power generation plants.
4. Implement new analysis cases for different types of generators.

## Context or pre-requisites
**Optimization Toolbox** by MathWorks.
Essential knowledge of Electrical Machines.

## Subjects or department where the activity can be used
**Electrical Machines**, **Electrical Power Systems** and **Stability of Power Systems**
Department of Electric Power

## Notes for Educators using the Activity
First, the data of the synchronous generator to be used is established. They can be ideal data or from a real machine.
Initial calculations are made per unit for the system. The initial calculations can be generated in MATLAB or in other software such as Excel or Python.
The safety limits are graphed one by one with the programming required in MATLAB, as it is very versatile and didactic in the generation of graphs, and in the Toolbox that allows the use of many options to solve non-linear algebraic equations such as the Optimization Toolbox.
MATLAB provides great support to the teacher when explaining the activity in class, if it were the case of being in person. In the Live Script the teacher can place important notes that he wants to share with the students.
Finally, the graphs obtained are analyzed and the input data is modified in order to carry out a comparison of cases and obtain conclusions together with the students.
The main tool is the MATLAB Live Script, the Optimization Toolbox is also required and Data Sheets on synchronous generators can be made available, if desired, because ideal data from synchronous machines can be used.
It is recommended to practice with the Live Script beforehand, to have ease of use before class. It is recommended to implement modifications for new courses using new data or new graphic resources.

## Evaluation
Once the students have obtained the graphical solution of the safe operating limits of the synchronous generator, it is the final solution of the exercise. The teacher can evaluate if the student was able to obtain the graphical solution, if all the limits (6 limits) were obtained and if they were obtained correctly.
